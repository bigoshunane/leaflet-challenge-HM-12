# Earthquake Analysis

## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Project objective

The objective of this project is to use data from United States Geological Survey (USGS for short) and display multiple and interactive maps with the location and magnitude of earthquakes during the last 7 days around the world for visualization.


### Technologies

   -  JavaScript 
   -  (Leaflet, D3)
   -  HTML
   -  CSS
   -  Mapbox-API
   -  Bootstrap

### Steps
The project has two steps with different levels of complexity.

Step-1

Building a single base layer map with one set of data.

Data: All Earthquakes for the last 7 days

Base layer: mapbox.greyscale:

Step-2

Map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

Multiple optional and interactive base layers were included.
An additional dataset and plot were included and they can be activated and deactivated by the user. Data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color. The map includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. Legends created that will provide context for the map data.

-  mapbox.greyscale
-  mapbox.satellite

Layer 2: Tectonic Plates
